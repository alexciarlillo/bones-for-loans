        Welcome to bones for loans! My name is Kaili, I am a biologist and newly minted bone carver. I recently started carving animal skulls, and discovered that I have a bit of a knack for it. A few internet strangers suggested that I should accept some commissioned work, and with a bit of encouragement and a bit more liquid courage from my old friend Evan Williams, here we are!

        Perhaps you are wondering about the name of this website. Like many people in my generation, I have student loans. Like, a lot of student loans. Like, maybe if Iâ€™m lucky I will have paid them off by the time I reach 100 kind of student loans. I am hoping to use the proceeds from this boney little endeavor to help pay those suckers off before I die.
