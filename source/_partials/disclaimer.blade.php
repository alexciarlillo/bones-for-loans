    <span class="font-bold">PLEASE NOTE:</span> All skulls MUST be sourced legally and ethically. No endangered or threatened species will be accepted as a donation or a commission. Anyone who sends an endangered/threatened species will be reported to U.S. Fish and Wildlife immediately. Additionally, please clean all bones before sending. USPS will not take kindly to smelly rotting packages sitting in my P.O. box. Thank you for you understanding!
