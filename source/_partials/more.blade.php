        I am hoping to one day open an online shop where I can sell my carvings. Before that can happen, I need to acquire some bones to carve. If you like my work and have an extra bone lying around that you are willing to donate, I created this site to allow you to do so. Please click the “donate” button in the drop down menu below. I opened a PO box to allow you, kind stranger, to donate your old bones to a good cause. Feel free to enter some design ideas or other thoughts in the “comments” section.

        I am also accepting commissions! However, while I work on getting this thing off the ground, I will only be doing commissions for those who already have a bone they would like me to carve. If you are interested in doing this, please click the “commission” button in the drop down menu below. If you don’t already have a bone, but would like to purchase one for me to carve, there are many sites online where you can buy them and have them sent directly to me. Please contact me using the box below for more information on prices, designs, and bone acquisition.
