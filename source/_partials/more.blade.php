    <p class="text-md">If you have read this far, perhaps you are interested in commissioning a piece from me. Or, perhaps you are just a kind stranger with an excess of bones on your hands. No judgments here! I am hoping to one day open up an etsy shop where I can sell my carvings. Before that can happen, I need to actually acquire some bones to carve! So here is where this site comes in. If you have a kind heart and an extra bone or two lying around that you would like to donate, I have created this site to allow you to do so. Please click the “donate” button below. I have opened a PO box (address coming soon!) to allow you, kind stranger, to donate your old bones to a good cause. Feel free to enter some design ideas or other thoughts in the “comments” section!</p>

    <p class="text-md">I am also accepting commissions! However, while I work on getting this thing off the ground, I will only be doing commissions for those who already have a bone they would like me to carve. If you are interested in doing this, please click the “commission” button below. You will send your skull (or other type of bone?) to my PO box. When I receive the piece, I will contact you to discuss general design preferences you may have, and we will settle on a price before I begin carving. Carved skulls generally sell for between $100 and $350 depending on the size and intricacy of the design. Given that I am still fairly new at this, I will start my commissions at the lower end of that spectrum.</p>
